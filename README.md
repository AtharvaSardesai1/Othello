Hard Disk: 500GB minimum\
Operating System: Windows/Linux/macOS 

**Software Requirements**\
Programming Language: Python
IDE: Visual Studio Code (or any preferred IDE)\
AI Techniques: Minimax Algorithm, Alpha-Beta Pruning\
Version Control: Git and GitHub

**Key Requirements**\
Game Board Implementation: A suitable data structure (e.g., 2D array) for managing the board state.\
AI Decision-Making: Application of the Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning for efficient and strategic moves.\
Memory Management: Efficient handling of game states during AI evaluations.\
Command-Line Interface: User-friendly interaction for players to make moves and observe the AI's actions.

## Development Methodology

The project follows the Incremental Model for structured development:
